## MODEL ##
 - update BETR: from heatmap to direct Regression
 Why?
    Misallignment between train and validation
 Details:
    ROI allign (at unpatchified decoder output) + MLP (final output diml': 27 ["center": 2, "offsets": 16, "center depth": 1, "depth offsets": 8])

## dataloader ##
 Matching sampling strategry between training set & validation set

--- FAILED..

NEW updating point. (
   너무 힘들다..
)
1. making a criterion of ordering corners (which point should a model predict?)
2. make model to predict each bb8 points (8 heatmaps)
